    This chicken and asparagus pasta is light but super tasty. Made with fresh asparagus and seasoned chicken.
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package dried penne pasta</li>
        <li>5 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>2 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cut into cubes</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon garlic powder, or more to taste</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>½ cup low-sodium chicken broth</li>
        <li>1 bunch slender asparagus spears, trimmed, cut on diagonal into 1-inch pieces</li>
        <li>1/2 cup water</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tsp dried basil leaves</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add penne and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain.</li><br>
        <li>While the pasta is cooking, heat 3 tablespoons oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Stir in chicken and season with 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Cook and stir until chicken is browned and the juices run clear, about 5 minutes. Transfer chicken to a paper towel-lined plate.</li><br>
        <li>Pour chicken broth into the skillet. Add asparagus, garlic, and another pinch of garlic powder. Season with salt and pepper. Cover and steam until asparagus is just tender, 5 to 10 minutes. Return chicken to the skillet and cook until heated through, 2 to 3 minutes.</li><br>
        <li>Transfer drained penne to a large bowl. Pour chicken mixture over top and mix until well combined. Let sit for about 5 minutes.</li><br>
        <li>Stir in remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil, then sprinkle with Parmesan cheese.</li><br>
    </ol>
